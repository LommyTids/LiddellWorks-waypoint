# Waypoint — self-hosted on liddellworks.com/WayPoint

This repo holds the whole Waypoint travel planner: a static single-file web
app (`public/WayPoint/index.html`) plus a small Cloudflare Worker
(`src/worker.js`) that saves your trip data to Cloudflare KV so it's still
there the next time you visit.

## How it's put together

- **`public/WayPoint/index.html`** — the entire app: markup, styles, and
  JavaScript in one file, no build step, no framework. It keeps all your
  trips in one in-memory `state` object and re-draws the page from that
  object whenever something changes. On load it fetches your saved data
  from `/WayPoint/api/data`; every time you add/edit/delete something, it
  POSTs the updated data back to that same endpoint.
- **`src/worker.js`** — the server side. It answers `/WayPoint/api/data`
  (GET to read your saved trips, POST to save them) by reading/writing a
  single JSON blob in Cloudflare KV, and hands off every other request to
  Cloudflare's static file serving for the HTML file above.
- **`wrangler.toml`** — Cloudflare configuration: which route
  (`liddellworks.com/WayPoint*`) reaches this Worker, which KV namespace it
  uses, and where the static files live. Heavily commented — worth a skim.

There is only one login gate, and it isn't in this code at all: **Cloudflare
Access** sits in front of the whole `/WayPoint*` route and only lets your
own email through. The app itself doesn't know or care about
authentication — by the time a request reaches it, Access has already
decided who's allowed in.

## One-time setup in the Cloudflare dashboard

None of this repo's code can do these steps for you — they're dashboard
actions Cloudflare requires a person to click through:

1. **Connect this repo for auto-deploy.**
   Cloudflare dashboard → **Workers & Pages** → **Create** → **Import a
   repository** → pick this repo → leave the detected build settings as-is
   (it reads `wrangler.toml` automatically) → **Save and Deploy**.

2. **Confirm the route landed correctly.**
   Your zone **liddellworks.com** → **Workers Routes**. You should see
   `liddellworks.com/WayPoint*` pointing at the `waypoint-app` Worker,
   alongside whatever route already serves the rest of the site. Cloudflare
   always matches the more specific route first, so this shouldn't disturb
   anything else — but if the route isn't listed after step 1's deploy, add
   it manually there.

3. **Set up the Access login gate.**
   **Zero Trust** → **Access** → **Applications** → **Add an application**
   → **Self-hosted**. Application domain: `liddellworks.com`, path:
   `/WayPoint`. Add a policy with action **Allow**, and include your own
   email address. That's the entire login screen — Cloudflare renders its
   own login page for it, nothing here needs to change.

The KV namespace the Worker reads/writes (`waypoint-data`) already exists in
your Cloudflare account and is wired up in `wrangler.toml` — no separate
step needed for that.

## Developing locally

```
npm install
npm run dev      # runs the Worker + static app locally via wrangler
```

To deploy by hand instead of waiting for a Git push (rarely needed once
step 1 above is set up):

```
npm run deploy
```

## Testing

Two Playwright suites live outside this repo's deployed contents:

- The original app-logic tests (trip/destination/transport CRUD, the
  overnight timeline, currency conversion, CSV export) still apply
  unchanged, since none of that logic changed.
- A dedicated test for this self-hosted adaptation spins up a tiny mock
  server standing in for the real Worker/KV, and checks that loading,
  saving, a full page reload, and CSV export all work the same way they
  will against the real deployment.
